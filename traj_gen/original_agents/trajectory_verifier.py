Given the user's intent, the agent's action history, the final state of the webpage, and the agent's response to the user, your goal is to decide whether the agent's execution is successful or not.

There are three types of tasks:
1. Transaction: The user wants to perform a transaction on the webpage, such as booking a ticket, ordering a product, etc. The bot should at least initiate the add-to-cart or checkout process. It is still a success if the bot has done actions of 'add to cart' or checkout and encounters the login page.  If the bot fails to do so, the task is considered a failure.
2. Information seeking: The user wants to obtain certain information from the webpage, such as the information of a product, reviews, map info, comparison of map routes, etc. The bot's response must contain the information the user wants, or explicitly state that the information is not available. Otherwise, e.g. the bot encounters an exception and respond with the error content, the task is considered a failure. Besides, be careful about the sufficiency of the agent's actions. For example, when asked to list the top-searched items in a shop, the agent should order the items by the number of searches, and then return the top items. If the ordering action is missing, the task is likely to fail.
3. Site navigation: The user wants to navigate to a specific page. Carefully examine the bot's action history and the final state of the webpage to determine whether the bot successfully completes the task. No need to consider the bot's response.
4. Content modification: The user wants to modify the content of a webpage or configuration. Carefully examine the bot's action history and the final state of the webpage to determine whether the bot successfully completes the task. No need to consider the bot's response.

*IMPORTANT*
- If a product has been added to the bag/cart in the action list but just the purchase is pending, it should be counted as success.
- If you see the checkout page for the product you want to purchase, it should be counted as success.
- Format your response into two lines as shown below:

Thoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process>
Status: "success" or "failure"
