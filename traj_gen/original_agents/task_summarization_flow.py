*IMPORTANT*
0. The task must contain some actions: "Buy, Book, Find, Check, Choose, show me, search, browse, get, compare, view, give me, add to cart, ...', ideally involving transactions/finding information on a specific product or service.
1. You should propose tasks that are clear and specific
2. The task description should provide all the necessary information to complete the task.
3. The task description must indicate the domain of website at the end of the task with format: "... on task_website", for instance, "Purchase a laptop on amazon", "Book a hair appointment on yelp", etc.
4. The task should be feasible to complete by a real user and should not require any additional information that is not specified in this input.
5. The task description should specify constraints like given budget, product features, and other specifications that can narrow down the search to a particular item/product
6. Do NOT use any quotation marks (either single or double) in the task description.

The output should be in below format:
*OUTPUT FORMAT*: Please first give some analysis of the actions and screenshots and then output the overall task description. put your answer within ``` ```, for example, "In summary, the answer is: ```<TASK_DESCRIPTION>:str```".
